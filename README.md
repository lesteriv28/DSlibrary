# Implementing my Own Data Structures Library
	
	In this Project I will be building and testing my own set of data structures. Starting with Mystring

## Mystring
	Implementing four functions that should have the same functionality as the string in string.h, mystrlen (returns length), mystrcmp (compares two strings), mystrdup(duplicates a string), and mystrcpy (copies a string into another one).
