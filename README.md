# Implementing my Own Data Structures Library

In this Project I will be building and testing my own set of data structures

## myString
Implementing four functions that should have the same functionality as the string in string.h.
- mystrlen (returns length)
- mystrcmp (compares two strings)
- mystrdup (duplicates a string)
- mystrcpy (copies a string into another one).

## myList
Implementing a seven functions Singly Linked List.
- List_createNode (creates a Node)
- List_insertHead (inserts at the head of the list)
- List_insertTail (inserts at the tail of the list)
- List_countNodes (counts the amount of Nodes in a list)
- List_findNode   (returns the first node holding the value of the item)
- List_deleteNode (deletes a node from the list and frees the memory)
- List_sort	  (uses bubble sort to sort the data of the list)
